					 <h3 style="color: red;">Hungrezy Restaurant</h3>  Our vision is to create a dining experience that foremost, feels like a place that you decide to call yours, and that you choose to share with your family and friends. We feel that we’re living within that vision because in the Spring of 2011 we had to create a larger space for our growing “neighbourhood” of much appreciated repeat guests. We’re incredibly grateful that when we built our new home and moved to a new location, our “neighbourhood” followed us. Thank you!
					Our promise is to continue to be that comfortable environment for you to come and break bread with your friends and family. We’re committed to excellence in food preparation, flavour and presentation by using quality, fresh ingredients. We’re passionate about creating homemade, home-style meals that satiate the appetite, satisfy the taste buds, and gratify the pocketbook.
					We invite you to check out our menu page to look over our enticing offerings, and then come in and experience for yourself why My Hungrezy Restaurant is everyone’s neighbourhood restaurant.
					We’re conveniently located and easily visible right on Highway
